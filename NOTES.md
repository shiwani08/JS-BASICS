# HTML
- BROWSER PARSES THE FILE FROM TOP TO BOTTOM
- HENCE IT A BEST PRACTICE TO ADD SCRIPT AT THE END

# CSS

# JS
<!-- Read all the comments in learning.js to revise the basics-->
- JS is a dynamically typed language - means that we dont have to specify the data type.
- run - {node script.js} to run the js code outside of the browser.. this basically shows the output of the console
- node uses chrome's v8 engine to render js code
- The var keyword was used in all JavaScript code from 1995 to 2015. The let and const keywords were added to JavaScript in 2015. The var keyword should only be used in code written for older browsers.
- Always use const if the type should not be changed (Arrays and Objects).
- Only use let if you can't use const
- Only use var if you MUST support old browsers.
## PRIMITIVE DATATYPES: 
  - strings
  - boolean
  - numbers
  - undefined (it is a type and also a value)
  - null
  - symbol
  - bigint
## REFERENCE DATATYPES: 
  - objects
  - array
  - fucntion
 ### FUN FACT - 'name' is a predefined global property. Hence it is best to avoid using this as a variable name

## DSA CORNER
 - Array and list are same in js. The offical term being array. 
 - These have in-built functions like .push(), .pop(), .map()
 - Length of the array is dynamic
